## Miscellaneous Information

Theta Station has come a long way and wanted to be an MRP build about the catastrophe.
Half a year later, the path has changed to PvP build. Largely thanks to `GH@IlinMihail/DSC@ilinm`. Official release with [trailer](https://youtu.be/wMnPygVKjAs) occurred on 2023-07-20.
